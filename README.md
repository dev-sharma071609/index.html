#  Vehicles vs Air Pollution (Practice Project)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project where I explored basic NumPy array creation and data visualization with Matplotlib.  
The project demonstrates how vehicle count affects air pollution levels using a simple scatter plot.

##  Project Overview

This mini project includes:
1. Array Creation with NumPy
   - One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
   - Random number generation
   - Array operations like `arange()`, `random()`, and `ones()`
2. Data Visualization
   - A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of vehicles and air pollution levels (AQI).

##  Libraries Used

- NumPy - For numerical operations and array manipulation  
- Matplotlib - For creating visualizations  

Install them (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
